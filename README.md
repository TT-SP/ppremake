# ppremake

The name _ppremake_ stands for Panda Pre-make; ppremake is a preprocessor that reads a series of source description files and generates a series of makefiles (or, potentially, other kinds of package build description files, like VC++ project files).  ppremake is used to build the various Panda3D source trees.

ppremake can be built on Windows and Unix platforms.  A Visual Studio solution is provided for building on Windows, and autoconf can be used for building on Unix (or Cygwin on Windows).

See [this file](doc/BUILD_FROM_SOURCE.txt) for instructions on how to build ppremake.

See [this page](../../wiki/Documentation) for documentation on ppremake, including its scripting language and how it processes source trees.
