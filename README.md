# ppremake

The name _ppremake_ stands for Panda Pre-make; ppremake is a preprocessor that reads a series of source description files and generates a series of makefiles (or, potentially, other kinds of package build description files, like VC++ project files).

ppremake can be built on Windows and Unix platforms. A Visual Studio solution is provided for building on Windows, and autoconf can be used for building on Unix (or Cygwin on Windows).

See [this file](BUILD_FROM_SOURCE.txt) for instructions on how to build ppremake.
